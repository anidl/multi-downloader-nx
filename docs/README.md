## Building and running from source

### Build Dependencies

Dependencies that are only required for running from code. These are not required if you are using the prebuilt binaries.

* NodeJS >= 18.0.0 (https://nodejs.org/)
* NPM >= 6.9.0 (https://www.npmjs.org/)
* PNPM >= 7.0.0 (https://pnpm.io/)

### Build Setup

Please note that NodeJS, NPM, and PNPM must be installed on your system. For instructions on how to install pnpm, check (https://pnpm.io/installation)

First clone this repo `git clone https://github.com/anidl/multi-downloader-nx.git`.

`cd` into the cloned directory and run `pnpm i`. Next, decide if you want to package the application, build the code, or run from typescript.

### Run from TypeScript

You can run the code from native TypeScript, this requires ts-node which you can install with pnpm with the following command: `pnpm -g i ts-node`

Afterwords, you can run the application like this:

* CLI: `ts-node -T ./index.ts --help`

### Run as JavaScript

If you want to build the application into JavaScript code to run, you can do that as well like this:

* CLI: `pnpm run prebuild-cli`
* GUI: `pnpm run prebuild-gui`

Then you can cd into the `lib` folder and you will be able to run the CLI or GUI as follows:

* CLI: `node ./index.js --help`
* GUI: `node ./gui.js`

### Build the application into an executable

If you want to package the application, run pnpm run build-`{platform}`-`{type}` where `{platform}` is the operating system (currently the choices are windows, linux, macos, alpine, android, and arm) and `{type}` is cli or gui.

## DRM Decryption

### Decryption Requirements

* mp4decrypt >= Any (http://www.bento4.com/) - Only required for decrypting (or shaka-packager)
* shaka-packager >= Any (https://github.com/shaka-project/shaka-packager/releases) - Only required for decrypting (or mp4decrypt)

### Instructions (Widevine)

In order to decrypt DRM content, you will need to have a dumped CDM, after that you will need to place the CDM files (`device_client_id_blob` and `device_private_key` or `client_id.bin` and `private_key.pem`) into the `./widevine/` directory. For legal reasons we do not include the CDM with the software, and you will have to source one yourself.

### Instructions (Playready)

Playready CDMs are very easy to obtain, you can find them even on Github.
Place the CDM in the `./playready/` directory and you're all set!
**IMPORTANT**: The Playready CDM (SL2000/SL3000) needs to be provisioned as a **V3 Device** by pyplayready (https://github.com/ready-dl/pyplayready).
